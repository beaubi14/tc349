	<h2>Final Project: My Design</h2>
	<div>For my final project, I would like to create a portfolio website for my Artwork. The goal of my website that would showcase my 2D and 3D art and my web and game design skills. This site would also provide the necessary background information and to allow an outlet for potential employers to have access to my resume. My site will also show some of the games that I had made at the Game Jam that I helped make during my time here at MSU.</div>
	<div>With this idea in mind, I performed the card sorting exercise with the same participants that I used for the previous card sorting exercise on the NASA Moon site. The result were extraordinarily similar, in the sense that most people wanted to group the Resume, About Me, and My Education sections together, and the art categories were generally grouped as well. It was common for the Game Jam Games and Web Design and Maintenance sections to be either in their own group or grouped with Social Media Link and Sites of Interest (likely due to a misinterpretation of the subject).</div>

		<h2>Card Sorting Data for My Site: Me</h2>

			<p> For organizing the information for my final project, I found that it would be easier to make three main categories. One would include all the art that I had worked on, one would be for my about information and a link to my resume, and the last would be contact info/my social media links.</p>

				<p> Similar to the way I structured my site, this participant found that the contact and about me section would be the same and would include all the art in another category. One of the categories may have been created out of confusion when they put the sites of interest in a group with Game Jam Games (games that I had made at Game Jams here on campus). This may have been do to confusion of the subject matter.</p>

				<p> This participant found that three categories would be the best information hierarchy for the site, grouping the contact and about me information togeter and putting the resume with the social media links for future employers. Similar to the rest of the participants, she also had all the art topics in a group, but included web design and maintenance with that category as well.</p>

	<h2>Card Sorting Data for My Site: Erin</h2>
	<div> </div
		<p> The participant create her information hierarchy with the concept of it being structured as a website. She created three sections for the website: a Main Page, Sidebar, Footer. The Main Page content consisted of About Me information, which included my resume and My Education. The sidebar section would contain the About Me again, then would include links to my artwork, Games that I had made, and sites of interest. The footer would include information on how to contact me, social media links and my web design information (which was mistaken to be information about how to contact the web developer of the actual site; this name may need to be revised in the future).</p>
