Project Three (Alpha)

game files:
-index.html
-stuff.js

	This project took me the least amount of time, but I feel that it is the sum of all the work that I had done. I used a lot of the code that I had previously made for past projects, and splined them together to make this game. I wanted to make a simple endless runner that would constantly generate objects for the player to evade, and built up speed as the player got farther. The main html file is named "index.html" and the javascript file is labelled "stuff.js". 
	

To play the game:

SPACE- jump
