Project Two (Beta)

game files:
-bob.html
-bob.js
-all contents in images folder
-all contents in audio folder

	For my beta project, I choose to make a simple platform-er with basic kill ability through jumping on the enemies heads. This file is labelled "bob.html" with its javascript file being "bob.js". I worked on this project with Alex Talcott, who helped researched the method for making the background move on the platform, giving the illusion of the scroll effect. This Project also incorporated elements from my previous game (such as gravity and acceleration) but used them to explore an area and to evade enemies. This project used simple sprite animations for the player and for certain enemies, and has sounds that play for when you deal damage or are dealt damage. Along with this project, I have included a mini-project I worked on where I tested loading images and changing their behavior based on the player state (base just on facing left or right); this mini-project is in alpha form but is not considered to be one of the main projects.

To play the game:

A- move left
D- move right
W- jump
ENTER - pause
